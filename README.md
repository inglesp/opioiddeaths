# Coroner Prevent Future Death (PFD) reports & opioid cases

This is a juypter notebook used to scrape all case information and all PDFs on Prevent Future Death Reports (PFDs) from the UK Courts & Tribunial website (https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/)

I am scraping this website for a study that will systematically analyse coronersâ€™ reports of PFDs in which an opioid was implicated in a death, and the responses to them. 

I plan to create a database/repository of cases using this website scrape.
